Multilevel Richardson-Romberg Extrapolation

In order to run different test, use:
```
make
```
on Linux.
For MacOSX users, use:
```
sh build.sh
```

To uninstall (only on linux), use
```
make clean
```

Then you will find out different executable files in `./executable`.
Use (BS barrier for example)
```
./executable/barrier.out
```
to load different results for differnet epsilon.
